Q1:How did you approach your task-
   While performing the tasks, the key challenges included:
             Understanding the problem: At times, breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps can be difficult.
             Finding solutions: Determining the best approach to solve certain issues requires careful analysis.
             Describing concisely: Writing clear and concise explanations to make the tasks easier for others to understand can be tricky.

Q2: What were the challenges you faced?
        While solving coding problems, some key challenges include:
             Understanding complex requirements: Interpreting what the problem demands and translating it into code can be challenging.
             Debugging issues: Identifying bugs or logic errors during testing can be time-consuming and requires careful analysis.
             Optimizing code: Ensuring the code is efficient and performs well, especially for large data sets or complex algorithms.
             Maintaining readability: Writing clean and maintainable code that is easy for others to understand and build upon.

Q3:And maybe even, a little bit about yourself-
            I’m passionate about coding and problem-solving. With a focus on Core Java development, 
            I enjoy learning new techniques and continuously improving my skills.
            Weather it’s debugging or optimizing code, 
            I strive to write solutions that are not only effective but also easy for others to follow and build upon.
